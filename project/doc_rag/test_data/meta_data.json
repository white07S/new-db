    "abstract": "The paper introduces MAKER, the first system to solve a task requiring over one million LLM-dependent steps with zero errors. It relies on extreme task decomposition into micro-agents, per-step error correction through a voting scheme, and red-flag filtering to remove unreliable outputs.",

    "summary": "LLMs fail on long-horizon tasks due to cumulative error. MAKER achieves zero-error execution over >1M steps by decomposing tasks into minimal subtasks, applying aggressive error correction, and filtering low-quality outputs. This demonstrates a new scalability path for AI systems without requiring ever-larger monolithic LLMs."
