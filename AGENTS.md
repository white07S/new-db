WE WILL BE WORKING INSIDE project folder.

This is uv based python project. 

so use uv add lib name and uv run to run the code.

always use absolute python package import style. no relative path import. 

we are using this this repo: https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT/tree/main as main 
ANYTIME CONFUSED USE THIS: here is also official docs: http://docs.dbgpt.cn/docs/overview/ OR THIS  https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT/tree/main

read this: http://docs.dbgpt.cn/docs/awel/cookbook/write_your_chat_database first. 



Also remember our tests folder is not like pytest, never write pytest mocks or fixtures, its like any typical script just to do dirty test, never also write command line test, hard code for now.
